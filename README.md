# Class Leaderboard Example

This example is from our class on October 26, 2013. It shows a simple application that lists the names of members of the class. It also shows how to structure a meteor application - client files go in the client folder, server files go in the server folder, and models (or other common code) go in the base of the project.

Please be sure to check out [The Meteor Docs](http://docs.meteor.com) and look up functions and commands that you've not seen before, like `Meteor.Collection()` or `People.find()` to learn more about how each component operates.
